;; navigation" at http://nathanmarz.com/blog/clojures-missing-piece.html .
;; Note that while there is no primitive test for a non-map collection, because of the way
;; that MAP-VALS works, the code below only tests for coll? when we are no longer looking at 
;; a map; it functions as a test for all non-map collections at that point.
;; (You might think that this function could be replaced by (walker sequential?), but
;; walker walks into maps as if they were sequences, and then sees MapEntrys as sequences.
;; Maybe would work with some more complex predicate instead of sequential?, but then
;; you're doing that multiple-test on every node.  I think that the def I give below
