  in mush-pref, and then adds the increment to mush-pref.  The core idea of the 
  increment calculation is that if the (somewhat random) appearance of a
  mushroom has a larger (smaller) value than the midpoint between the two 
  actual mushroom sizes, and the mushroom's nutrition turns out to be positive,
  then that's a reason to think that larger (smaller) mushrooms are nutritious,
  and the opposite for negative nutritional values.  Thus it makes sense to
  calculate the increment as a scaled value of the product of the mushroom's 
  nutrition and the difference between the appearance and the midpoint.  Thus
  positive values of mush-pref mean that in the past large mushrooms have often
  be nutritious, while negative values mean that small mushrooms have more
  often been nutritious, on average."

  "Like r-snipe-pref (which is called by this function), except that this
  function tries to set the snipe's mush-pref preference value by copying
  it from one of those neighbors that have the most energy.  This will 
  occur every time this function is called as long as the snipe still has 
  its initial mush-pref of 0.0.  Once it acquires a different preference,
  it will retain that preference for the rest of its life.  (Thus s-snipes
  are like r-snipes, except that while r-snipe preferences are the result
  of an initial random developmental process, s-snipe preferences are
  acquired through early social learning.)  Neighbors include all snipes
  within neighbor-radius of this snipe's location, *in both subenvs*: 
  The subenvs are thus treated as spatially identical but functionally 
  different domains of interest.  Snipes in one domain are obligate 
  specialists in the mushrooms of their own domain--their \"subenv\", but
